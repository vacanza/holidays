    Jersey has the same public holidays as the United Kingdom (England Subdivision)
    - plus an extra day on 9 May, to mark Liberation Day (ignoring special holidays
    like the Corn Riots Anniversary in 2021).

    If a bank holiday is on a sunday, a substitute weekday becomes a bank holiday,
    normally the following Monday. From 2004 onwards this also applies to saturday.

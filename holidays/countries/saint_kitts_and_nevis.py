    If Sovereign's Birthday, New Year's Day, Independence Day, or National Heroes Day
    fall on a Sunday the next following Monday shall be a public holiday.

    Boxing Dayâ€”that is the day after Christmas Day, but if Christmas Day falls
    on a Saturday, then the next following Monday shall be a public holiday, and if
    Christmas Day falls on a Sunday, then the next following Monday and Tuesday
    shall be public holidays.

    While Culturama Day (first started in 1974) and Carnival Day are never officially
    included in the main Chapter 23.23 document, they're de facto added since at least
    2015 and should be considered as such.

    If any of the holidays enumerated in section 701 of this chapter falls on Sunday, the
    following Monday shall be observed as a holiday. If any of the holidays enumerated in
    section 701 of this chapter falls on Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be observed
    as a holiday.

    As there's no record of President's Day (Jun 1) and Independence Day (Oct 1) being
    legal holiday before 2017, as seen in RPRL 10-15, they shall be assumed to start in 2018
    for our current implementation.

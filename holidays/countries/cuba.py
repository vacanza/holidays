        Note: for holidays that can be moved to a Monday if they fall on a
              Sunday, between 1984 and 2013, the State Committee of Work and
              Social Security would determine if they would be moved to the
              Monday, or if they would stay on the Sunday, presumably depending
              on quotas. After 2013, they always move to Monday. I could not
              find any records of this, so I implemented this making it always
              go to the next Monday.

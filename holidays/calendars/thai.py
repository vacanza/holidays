    ** Thai Lunar Calendar Holidays only work from 1941 (B.E. 2484) onwards
       until 2057 (B.E. 2600) as we only have Thai year-type data for
       cross-checking until then.

    So here are the basics of the Thai Lunar Calendar
        3-year types for calendar intercalation:
            - Pakatimat (Normal Year):
                    consist of 12 months, has 354 days.
            - Athikawan (Extra-Day Year): a
                    add a day to the 7th month of the year, has 355 days
                    for the synodic month correction.
            - Athikamat (Extra-Month Year):
                    we have the 8th month twice, has 384 days for the
                    sidereal year correction.

        Each month either has 30 (Even months) or 29 (Odd months)
            - The waxing phase has 15 days until Full Moon and waning
                phase 14 (Odd Months)/15 (Even Months/
                Month 7 of Athikawan years) days for the New Moon.
            - The second "Month 8" for Athikamat years is called
                "Month 8.8", with all observed holy days delayed from
                the usual calendar by 1 month.

    List of public holidays dependent on the Thai Lunar Calendar:
        - Magha Puja/Makha Bucha:
                15th Waxing Day (Full Moon) of Month 3
                (On Month 4 for Athikamat Years).
        - Royal Ploughing Ceremony:
                Based on this, though Court Astrologer picks the
                auspicious dates, which sadly don't fall into a
                predictable pattern; see its specific section below.
        - Vesak/Visakha Bucha:
                15th Waxing Day (Full Moon) of Month 6
                (On Month 7 for Athikamat Years).
        - Asalha Puja/Asarnha Bucha:
                15th Waxing Day (Full Moon) of Month 8
                (On Month 8/8 for Athikamat Years).
        - Buddhist Lent Day/Wan Khao Phansa:
                1st Waning Day of Month 8
                (On Month 8/8 for Athikamat Years).

    Other Buddhist date on Thai Lunar Calendar:
        - Buddha's Cremation Day/Atthami Bucha
                8th Waning Day of  Month 6
                (On Month 7 for Athikamat Years).
        - End of Buddhist Lent Day/Ok Phansa:
                15th Waxing Day (Full Moon) of Month 11

    The following code is based on Ninenik Narkdee's PHP implementation,
    and we're thankful for his work.

    Please avoid touching the Athikawan and Athikamat declaration array
    at all costs unless you can find sources for them somewhere for 2057++

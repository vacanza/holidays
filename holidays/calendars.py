    ** Thai Lunar Calendar Holidays only work from 1941 (B.E. 2484) onwards
       until 2057 (B.E. 2600) as we only have Thai year-type data for
       cross-checking until then.

    So here are the basics of the Thai Lunar Calendar
        3-year types for calendar intercalation:
            - Pakatimat (Normal Year):
                    consist of 12 months, has 354 days.
            - Athikawan (Extra-Day Year): a
                    add a day to the 7th month of the year, has 355 days
                    for the synodic month correction.
            - Athikamat (Extra-Month Year):
                    we have the 8th month twice, has 384 days for the
                    sidereal year correction.

        Each month either has 30 (Even months) or 29 (Odd months)
            - The waxing phase has 15 days until Full Moon and waning
                phase 14 (Odd Months)/15 (Even Months/
                Month 7 of Athikawan years) days for the New Moon.
            - The second "Month 8" for Athikamat years is called
                "Month 8.8", with all observed holy days delayed from
                the usual calendar by 1 month.

    List of public holidays dependent on the Thai Lunar Calendar:
        - Magha Puja/Makha Bucha:
                15th Waxing Day (Full Moon) of Month 3
                (On Month 4 for Athikamat Years).
        - Royal Ploughing Ceremony:
                Based on this, though Court Astrologer picks the
                auspicious dates, which sadly don't fall into a
                predictable pattern; see its specific section below.
        - Vesak/Visakha Bucha:
                15th Waxing Day (Full Moon) of Month 6
                (On Month 7 for Athikamat Years).
        - Asalha Puja/Asarnha Bucha:
                15th Waxing Day (Full Moon) of Month 8
                (On Month 8/8 for Athikamat Years).
        - Buddhist Lent Day/Wan Khao Phansa:
                1st Waning Day of Month 8
                (On Month 8/8 for Athikamat Years).

    Other Buddhist date on Thai Lunar Calendar:
        - Buddha's Cremation Day/Atthami Bucha
                8th Waning Day of  Month 6
                (On Month 7 for Athikamat Years).
        - End of Buddhist Lent Day/Ok Phansa:
                15th Waxing Day (Full Moon) of Month 11

    The following code is based on Ninenik Narkdee's PHP implementation,

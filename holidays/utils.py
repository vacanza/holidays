    """Return a new dictionary-like [HolidayBase][holidays.holiday_base.HolidayBase] object.

    Include public holidays for the country matching `country` and other keyword arguments.

    Args:
        country:
            An ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 country code.

        subdiv:
            The subdivision (e.g. state or province) as a ISO 3166-2 code
            or its alias; not implemented for all countries (see documentation).

        years:
            The year(s) to pre-calculate public holidays for at instantiation.

        expand:
            Whether the entire year is calculated when one date from that year
            is requested.

        observed:
            Whether to include the dates of when public holidays are observed
            (e.g. a holiday falling on a Sunday being observed the following
            Monday). `False` may not work for all countries.

        prov:
            *deprecated* use `subdiv` instead.

        state:
            *deprecated* use `subdiv` instead.

        language:
            Specifies the language in which holiday names are returned.

            Accepts either:

            * A two-letter ISO 639-1 language code (e.g., 'en' for English, 'fr' for French),
                or
            * A language and entity combination using an underscore (e.g., 'en_US' for U.S.
                English, 'pt_BR' for Brazilian Portuguese).

            !!! warning
                The provided language or locale code must be supported by the holiday
                entity. Unsupported values will result in names being shown in the entity's
                original language.

            If not explicitly set (`language=None`), the system attempts to infer the
            language from the environment's locale settings. The following environment
            variables are checked, in order of precedence: LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG.

            If none of these are set or they are empty, holiday names will default to the
            original language of the entity's holiday implementation.

            !!! warning
                This fallback mechanism may yield inconsistent results across environments
                (e.g., between a terminal session and a Jupyter notebook).

            To ensure consistent behavior, it is recommended to set the language parameter
            explicitly. If the specified language is not supported, holiday names will remain
            in the original language of the entity's holiday implementation.

            This behavior will be updated and formalized in v1.

        categories:
            Requested holiday categories.

    Returns:
        A `HolidayBase` object matching the `country`.

    The key of the `dict`-like `HolidayBase` object is the
    `date` of the holiday, and the value is the name of the holiday itself.
    Dates where a key is not present are not public holidays (or, if
    `observed` is `False`, days when a public holiday is observed).

    When passing the `date` as a key, the `date` can be expressed in one of the
    following types:

    * `datetime.date`,
    * `datetime.datetime`,
    * a `str` of any format recognized by `dateutil.parser.parse()`,
    * or a `float` or `int` representing a POSIX timestamp.

    The key is always returned as a `datetime.date` object.

    To maximize speed, the list of public holidays is built on the fly as
    needed, one calendar year at a time. When the object is instantiated
    without a `years` parameter, it is empty, but, unless `expand` is set
    to `False`, as soon as a key is accessed the class will calculate that entire
    year's list of holidays and set the keys with them.

    If you need to list the holidays as opposed to querying individual dates,
    instantiate the class with the `years` parameter.

    Example usage:

        >>> from holidays import country_holidays
        >>> us_holidays = country_holidays('US')
        # For a specific subdivision (e.g. state or province):
        >>> calif_holidays = country_holidays('US', subdiv='CA')

    The below will cause 2015 holidays to be calculated on the fly:

        >>> from datetime import date
        >>> assert date(2015, 1, 1) in us_holidays

    This will be faster because 2015 holidays are already calculated:

        >>> assert date(2015, 1, 2) not in us_holidays

    The `HolidayBase` class also recognizes strings of many formats
    and numbers representing a POSIX timestamp:

        >>> assert '2014-01-01' in us_holidays
        >>> assert '1/1/2014' in us_holidays
        >>> assert 1388597445 in us_holidays

    Show the holiday's name:

        >>> us_holidays.get('2014-01-01')
        "New Year's Day"

    Check a range:

        >>> us_holidays['2014-01-01': '2014-01-03']
        [datetime.date(2014, 1, 1)]

    List all 2020 holidays:

        >>> us_holidays = country_holidays('US', years=2020)
        >>> for day in sorted(us_holidays.items()):
        ...     print(day)
        (datetime.date(2020, 1, 1), "New Year's Day")
        (datetime.date(2020, 1, 20), 'Martin Luther King Jr. Day')
        (datetime.date(2020, 2, 17), "Washington's Birthday")
        (datetime.date(2020, 5, 25), 'Memorial Day')
        (datetime.date(2020, 7, 3), 'Independence Day (observed)')
        (datetime.date(2020, 7, 4), 'Independence Day')
        (datetime.date(2020, 9, 7), 'Labor Day')
        (datetime.date(2020, 10, 12), 'Columbus Day')
        (datetime.date(2020, 11, 11), 'Veterans Day')
        (datetime.date(2020, 11, 26), 'Thanksgiving Day')
        (datetime.date(2020, 12, 25), 'Christmas Day')

    Some holidays are only present in parts of a country:

        >>> us_pr_holidays = country_holidays('US', subdiv='PR')
        >>> assert '2018-01-06' not in us_holidays
        >>> assert '2018-01-06' in us_pr_holidays

    Append custom holiday dates by passing one of:

    * a `dict` with date/name key/value pairs (e.g.
      `{'2010-07-10': 'My birthday!'}`),
    * a list of dates (as a `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`,
      `str`, `int`, or `float`); "Holiday" will be used as a description,
    * or a single date item (of one of the types above); "Holiday" will be
      used as a description:

    ```python
    >>> custom_holidays = country_holidays('US', years=2015)
    >>> custom_holidays.update({'2015-01-01': "New Year's Day"})
    >>> custom_holidays.update(['2015-07-01', '07/04/2015'])
    >>> custom_holidays.update(date(2015, 12, 25))
    >>> assert date(2015, 1, 1) in custom_holidays
    >>> assert date(2015, 1, 2) not in custom_holidays
    >>> assert '12/25/2015' in custom_holidays
    ```

    For more complex logic, like 4th Monday of January, you can inherit the
    `HolidayBase` class and define your own `_populate` method.
    See documentation for examples.

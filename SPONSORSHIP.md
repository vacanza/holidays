The **Open World Holidays Framework** is launching a sponsorship initiative to support **high-quality, independent contributions** to the project. This program is **not tied to specific coding events** such as Google Summer of Code or Winter of Code. Instead, it is designed to recognize and reward meaningful work from contributors **year-round**, based on our available budget.

## Program Goals

- Encourage ongoing, impactful contributions from developers and holiday data researchers
- Provide fair compensation for time-intensive tasks
- Support the long-term sustainability and growth of the framework

## Current Funding

This program is currently supported through the [Tidelift Maintainer Program](https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/pypi/holidays), where we receive compensation based on the usage and maintenance of the `holidays` Python package. We are reinvesting these earnings to sponsor contributions to the Open World Holidays Framework.

We are actively exploring additional sources of funding and will provide updates as new opportunities arise.

## Sponsorship Amounts

The amount sponsored will vary depending on the complexity of the task:

| Task Size | Description                                                                                    | Compensation |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Medium    | Tasks such as implementing holidays for a new entity using well-established templates or rules | \$25 USD     |
| Big       | Tasks requiring profound research, localization, or custom rule logic                            | \$50 USD     |

*Note: These rates are subject to available funding and do not include any additional fees imposed by payment processors.*

## Eligibility

To participate in the sponsorship program, contributors must:

- Have successfully implemented at least one entity’s holiday support (not necessarily through the sponsorship program)
- Not be currently receiving payment through other structured coding programs (e.g., GSoC, Outreachy)
- Have a **GitHub Sponsors account set up and eligible to receive payments** (check [GitHub’s supported countries](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#supported-regions-for-github-sponsors))
- Ensure their country is eligible to receive payouts under GitHub Sponsors requirements

If GitHub Sponsors are not available for the contributor's country, we may consider **alternative payment options** (e.g., crypto wallets, bank transfer, etc.) on a **case-by-case basis**.

## Payment Process

- **Our preferred method of payment is GitHub Sponsors**
- Payments are processed after the sponsored task is released officially, typically on the **1st and 3rd Monday of each month**
- Contributors are responsible for setting up and maintaining their payment details in GitHub Sponsors or any approved alternative method
- **We do not cover any transaction or processing fees** imposed by [GitHub Sponsors](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-github-sponsors), banks, or other platforms. The amounts listed in the [Sponsorship Amounts](#sponsorship-amounts) section represent the **maximum compensation per task before fees**
